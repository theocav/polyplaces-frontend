# Backend Spec: GET /api/config

## Purpose

Frontend fetches this endpoint on page load to retrieve runtime configuration,
including secrets that must not be stored in the git repository. Eliminates the
need to commit sensitive values (e.g. Sentry DSN) to source control.

---

## Endpoint

```
GET /api/config
```

No authentication required. This is a public endpoint — the values returned are
consumed by client-side JavaScript, so treat them as non-secret in the sense that
any browser can read them. The point is to keep them out of source control and
deployable artifacts.

---

## Request

No body. No query parameters. No auth headers.

---

## Response

**Status:** `200 OK`  
**Content-Type:** `application/json`

```json
{
  "POLYPLACES_API_BASE_URL": "https://api.polyplaces.co.uk/",
  "POLYPLACES_SITE_URL": "https://polyplaces.co.uk",
  "POLYPLACES_NOMINATIM_URL": "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search",
  "POLYPLACES_SEARCH_COUNTRY_CODES": "gb",
  "POLYPLACES_SEARCH_VIEWBOX": "-8.7,60.9,1.9,49.8",
  "SENTRY_DSN": "https://c331c8882cbb042155dea75637633412@o4511310145781760.ingest.de.sentry.io/4511310163017808"
}
```

All fields must be present. If a value is not applicable for an environment
(e.g. no Sentry in staging), return an empty string for that key rather than
omitting it.

## Current values (production)

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `POLYPLACES_API_BASE_URL` | `https://api.polyplaces.co.uk/` |
| `POLYPLACES_SITE_URL` | `https://polyplaces.co.uk` |
| `POLYPLACES_NOMINATIM_URL` | `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search` |
| `POLYPLACES_SEARCH_COUNTRY_CODES` | `gb` |
| `POLYPLACES_SEARCH_VIEWBOX` | `-8.7,60.9,1.9,49.8` |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | `https://c331c8882cbb042155dea75637633412@o4511310145781760.ingest.de.sentry.io/4511310163017808` |

---

## Required response headers

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://polyplaces.co.uk
Cache-Control: no-store
```

- `no-store` prevents CDN/proxy from caching a stale or wrong-environment config.
- CORS must be restricted to `https://polyplaces.co.uk` only (not `*`).
- For local dev, also allow `http://localhost:*` (or whatever local origin is used).

---

## Error behaviour

If the backend cannot serve config (e.g. env vars not set), return `503` with no
body rather than a partial JSON object. The frontend handles fetch failure
gracefully — Sentry will be inactive for that session and all other config falls
back to hardcoded defaults. A silent failure is better than a broken JSON
response that crashes the parse.

---

## Notes for frontend integration

- Frontend fires this fetch immediately on page load with `cache: 'no-store'`.
- It does not block page render — store defaults are set before the fetch so the
  UI is functional even if the request is slow.
- Sentry is initialised only after this fetch resolves. Any errors thrown in the
  first ~200ms of page load will not be captured. Acceptable tradeoff.
- `POLYPLACES_API_BASE_URL` in the response is used to override the bootstrap
  value from `env.js`. Both should point to the same host in production.
